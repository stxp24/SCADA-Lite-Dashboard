A lightweight SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system written in Java.  
It simulates plant data (temperature, pressure, motor control) and provides monitoring + control features.

## Features
- **Phase 1 (CLI Prototype)**
  - Real-time sensor simulation (temperature & pressure).
  - Motor ON/OFF control (affects temperature).
  - Periodic updates printed to console.
  - Pause/resume functionality.
  - Alarm messages for high temperature or pressure.
  - Trend logging (history of values).

- **Phase 2 (Planned)**
  - REST API (readings, control, trends).
  - Client dashboard (JavaFX or web-based).
  - Alarms exposed via API.
  - Data persistence (SQLite).

- **Phase 3 (Stretch Goals)**
  - WebSocket API for real-time streaming.
  - Authentication & role-based access.
  - Graphical HMI with charts, gauges, and alarms.

## Architecture
- **Data Layer**: Simulated sensors & actuators.
- **Control Layer**: API for reading/writing values.
- **Presentation Layer**: CLI (Phase 1), GUI/Web Dashboard (future phases).
