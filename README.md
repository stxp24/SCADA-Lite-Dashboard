# SCADA-Lite-Dashboard
A Java-based SCADA-lite system that simulates industrial sensors and actuators, with a command-line interface prototype and planned evolution into a RESTful API + dashboard.  This project is designed as a learning exercise in industrial software engineering, covering phases from simple simulation to networked monitoring and control.
